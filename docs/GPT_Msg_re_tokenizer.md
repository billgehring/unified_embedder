> You’re right to question the “skipped” total. Here’s what’s going on and what I changed to make it transparent.

  Why so many skipped

  - We intentionally skip certain files:
      - _meta.json sidecars
      - Transcript index artifacts (metadata-only)
      - Images (we store metadata only; no embedding)
      - Unsupported extensions (not in {txt, pdf, docx, pptx, xml, vtt})
  - In Canvas exports, there are often thousands of non-embeddable artifacts (images, thumbnails, zips, duplicates, indexes). Those count as “skipped” in our totals.

  What I added

  - Skip reasons recorded
      - Each skipped file now surfaces a reason: meta_json, image, transcript_index, unsupported.
  - Skip report file
      - After processing, we now write logs/skipped_files_<timestamp>.json with an entry per skipped file:
          - path, reason, and a few helpful meta fields (filename, file_path, ocr_engine_used, ocr_reprocessed if present).
      - We also log a reason histogram, e.g., “Skip reasons: {‘image’: 3200, ‘meta_json’: 600, ‘unsupported’: 406}”.
  - More explicit logger lines
      - When a future returns a skipped result, the debug log shows the reason: “Skipped file: /path… (image)”.
  - Optional filtering
      - SKIP_PATTERNS lets you exclude specific files or directories (glob or substring), and these are counted in the initial scan “skipped X files” message.

  Where this shows up in code

  - unified_embedder.py
      - process_file now returns a structured skip record with reason for:
          - _meta.json (meta_json)
          - images (image)
          - unsupported types (unsupported)
          - transcript indexes (transcript_index)
      - After processing, we generate the JSON skip report and log reason counts.
      - During future processing, when a file is skipped we include the reason in the debug message.

  What to do

  - Re-run your current job; at the end you should see:
      - “Wrote skip report with N entries to logs/skipped_files_<time>.json”
      - “Skip reasons: {…}”
  - Open the JSON to inspect exactly what was skipped and why.
  - If we’re skipping too aggressively (e.g., you want certain extensions embedded), we can add those to EMBEDDABLE_EXTENSIONS, or narrow the “unsupported” category.

  Notes about your numbers

  - You reported 179 processed, 4206 skipped. Given a 4k+ file tree, that ratio is totally plausible if the dataset includes many images, non-text artifacts, or transcripts. The new report
  will make it easy to confirm and adjust.

  Still want finer control?

  - We can add a CLI flag to include images as OCR targets (not recommended unless they’re scans).
  - We can also add an allowlist of extensions via env/CLI to expand embeddable file types for this run.

▌should I use a different tokenizer with > 512?

> Short answer: only if your embedder supports >512. Otherwise, keep chunks ≤512.

  - With BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 (your current dense model), the effective max sequence length is 512. Using a tokenizer with a larger max just shifts the warning; the embedder will still
  truncate at 512. Best practice:
      - Set CHUNKER_MAX_TOKENS=512
      - Optionally set CHUNKER_TOKENIZER="BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5" (or leave the default MiniLM tokenizer; either is fine as long as the limit is 512)
  - If you truly want longer chunks, switch to a long‑context embedding model:
      - Recommended: BAAI/bge-m3 (supports up to 8192 tokens)
      - Then align the chunker and env:
          - --embedding_model "BAAI/bge-m3"
          - export CHUNKER_TOKENIZER="BAAI/bge-m3"
          - export CHUNKER_MAX_TOKENS=2048 or 4096 (balance context vs speed/memory)
      - Expect higher memory and slower throughput; verify Qdrant dim is updated (we compute embedding dimension automatically).
  - About the warning
      - “Token indices sequence length … 571 > 512” is a tokenizer warning. It indicates potential truncation if a downstream model can’t accept that length. It’s safe to silence by
  capping CHUNKER_MAX_TOKENS at the embedder’s limit (512 for bge-large).
  - ColBERT is separate
      - ColBERT tokens are produced independently via FastEmbed LateInteraction and don’t change the dense chunking limit. You don’t need a >512 tokenizer for ColBERT to work.

  Quick setting for your current run

  - export CHUNKER_MAX_TOKENS=512
  - Keep BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5
  - Re-run; you won’t see the >512 warning, and your chunks will match the embedder’s capacity.
